# A'Lotl Axolotls

Current version: 1.0

This is the official pack repository for A'Lotl Axolotls! Feel free to report any bugs or leave suggestions in the [Issues](https://github.com/LunaBytes/A-Lotl-Axolotls/issues) tab.
Check out more of my packs at [LunaByte](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/lunabyte/) on Planet Minecraft!

Q: "Will you add the firefly axolotl?"<br/>
A: No, firefly axolotls were genetically engineered and are not naturally occuring. Then why is the chimera in here? Chimera axolotls can occur naturally! My goal is to only add natural and realistic species to this pack.

Q: "What's the difference between leucistic and albino?"<br/>
A: I didn't know until I made this pack! While both are genetic mutations, albinism is an absence of melanin, while leucism is a reduction of all types of pigmentation, not just melanin, so they may have muted or patchy coloring. Leucism can also vary between individuals.

## Goals
- Add the option to nametag axolotls for a specific skin instead of finding a naturally spawning one. This may be added to the base pack or released as a seperate one (most likely the latter).
- Add CIT bucket textures for nametagged axolotls.
- Add an albino axolotl? It looks kinda creepy if you do it wrong. But maybe!

### Mod Migration
- At some point I want to make the skins more dynamic to get, such as breeding a Lucy with a Melanoid having the chance to prodcuce a Chimera baby. Also currently Chimera and GFP axolotls are locked behind Blue, which can only be bred. I may change this so they spawn naturally, albiet rarely.
- In reality, I want Blue axolotls to spawn naturally (with their vanilla 0.083% chance of course).
- Both Chimera and GFP Axolotls will remain rare, just not as rare as Blue.
- This might only be accomplishable by either finding a supplementary mod or just making one myself.

## Known Issues

- The custom axolotl texture is not represented when placed in a bucket, only the variant, due to the limitations of CIT. For example, an Axolotl Bucket containing a Varian:0 (Lucy) axolotl bearing the Lavender texture will only show the Lucy texture. However, do not worry! The texture of the entity within the bucket will remain the same.
- Axolotls caught in buckets will not retain their CIT texture.
- When pairing Optifine/CIT Resewn with [More Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/moreculling), items will not display their CIT texture in Item Frames.
  - Current workaround: Have [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/) installed. Find **More Culling**, click on it, and click the `Configure...` button. From here, find `Custom Item Frame Renderer` and set it to off.
  - Or, use [Entity Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/entityculling) instead (this is what I use personally).
