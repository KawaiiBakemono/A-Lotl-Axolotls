Q: "Will you add the firefly axolotl?"<br/>
A: No, firefly axolotls were genetically engineered and are not naturally occuring. Then why is the chimera in here? Chimera axolotls can occur naturally! My goal is to only add natural and realistic species to this pack.

Q: "What's the difference between leucistic and albino?"<br/>
A: I didn't know until I made this pack! While both are genetic mutations, albinism is an absence of melanin, while leucism is a reduction of all types of pigmentation, not just melanin, so they may have muted or patchy coloring. Leucism can also vary between individuals.

## Goals
- Add the option to nametag axolotls for a specific skin instead of finding a naturally spawning one. This may be added to the base pack or released as a seperate one (most likely the latter).
- Add CIT bucket textures for nametagged axolotls.
- Add an albino axolotl? It looks kinda creepy if you do it wrong. But maybe!

## Known Issues

- The custom axolotl texture is not represented when placed in a bucket, only the variant, due to the limitations of CIT. For example, an Axolotl Bucket containing a variant 0 axolotl bearing the Lavender texture will only show the Lucy texture. However, do not worry! The texture of the entity within the bucket will remain the same.
